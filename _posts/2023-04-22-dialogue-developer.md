*A lone developer was walking uphill, their feet unstable over the fine-grained black sand of the terrain. Sweat droplets were falling from their face to the ground, forming tiny rivers that went unnoticed.*

*The sky was as dark as the annoying sand, except for a few distant, colorful planets. Its stillness would have resembled a painting, if not for the falling stars that appeared as fast as they disappeared. Undoubtedly, it was a special night.*

**Developer**: I hate this sand. It's all into my shoes.

*A few minutes later, as the slope of the hill got gentler, they saw a small figure curved on the ground frenetically moving their hands. As the developer got closer, they recognized that it was a young person playing with the sand.*

**Developer**: hey there, what're you up to?

**Youngster**: hi, I'm developing my first video game! You see, I can draw characters with the sand and give them life through blocks of code! It's a game about a ball that must escape a ghost for as long as possible. Do you want to try it?

    <i>The sand reorganized itself, the shapes of a ghost and a ball appeared, and the former started chasing the latter.</i>

**Youngster**: haha! You didn't beat my highscore of <span id="boyScore">0</span>!

**Developer**: it was really fun, well done! You know, I write code as well, I'm a software developer.

**Youngster**: wow, that's so cool! My dream is to become a programmer too! I want to know all the programming languages in the world!

**Developer**: haha, sounds nice, but learning all the programming languages in the world is both impossible and useless. It's impossible because there are too much of them, new ones are probably being created right now as we're talking. And it's useless because you just need to know the programming languages and libraries useful for the particular project you're working on. It's better to focus on learning just a bunch of them really well, rather than knowing all of them poorly.

**Youngster**: oh, okay, but I like learning a new programming language!

**Developer**: yes, I see, and that's good from time to time. But I suggest that you focus on some programming languages to become proficient with them and also learn about the ecosystem of tools and libraries offered by that language. You'll become a lot more productive and you'll be able to build a lot of things in no time!

**Youngster**: I really don't like libraries and frameworks, I like to write everything from scratch! If I use a library then I get to write less code and that's not fun!

**Developer**: oh god! Remember that you're writing code to create some new product. That's your *goal*. You should spend the shortest time possible coding and focus on other more important tasks. Ideally we should have a tool that, given our requirements, writes all the code needed. In a way, code is just a chore, a chore that we're forced to do because it's how we interact and instruct computers. If we had an intelligent tool that writes code for us, nobody would write code anymore, but just focus on more important things like requirements analysis, product design, market research. It'd be a dream to be able to build new useful products that fast!

**Youngster**: oh no, that's a nightmare! I like to make experiments with code and build everything that comes across my mind, even though my software is not useful. I find it fun just to write code!

**Developer**: it seems like you don't listen. Do you really want to waste your time coding useless things?? Writing the same lines of code over and over, creating a software that nobody, except you, can use??

**Youngster**: yes, because I like doing it.

**Developer**: you're so stupid. Coding will become a chore for you in no time! It won't be fun anymore and, moreover, you'll achieve nothing in your developer career! Nobody will use your software, so you'll have no fulfillment from it either! CODE IS JUST A TOOL TO REACH A GOAL!

*As the developer stopped yelling, the youngster became really serious. He seemed absent-minded. After a while, the young person started crying. For reasons that goes beyond comprehension, tears were getting bigger each drop, and formed puddles on the sand that quickly became rivers running downhill in all directions. Terrified, the developer hopelessy tried to run away, but their body was already caught by the fast tears rivers. As he started sinking in the sand he hated so much, the developer took a last look at the youngster: they were now ominously big. Just before disappearing under the sand, the developer was crying too.*
